## Questions
<details>
 <summary>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</summary>
 <p>Computer scientist are problem solvers. They take a problem and apply various technology to solve the problem.</p>

<details>
 <summary>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?</summary>
 <p>My approach was to first understand the problem. View it from multiple angles and see how the pieces of the project could possibly fit together. Then comes the planning phase, creating diagrams for the database, and the system. Additionally, researching appropriate technology to be utilized is esential in not only solving the problem, but elevating it. Getting the database up and running came first for the implementation. Next, the CRUD Python script for interacting with the database. Finally, creating the dashboard application and setting up the user experience. All while testing every component along the way, ensuring a smooth transition to the finish line of the project.</p>
